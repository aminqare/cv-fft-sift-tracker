# CV-FFT-SIFT-Tracker

A collection of computer-vision experiments demonstrating:

1. **Hybrid Image Creation** via FFT and Gaussian filters  
2. **SIFT-Based Feature Detection & Matching**  
3. **A Lossless Ball-in-Rotated-Box Simulation** with elastic collisions  
4. **FFT-Feature Tracking of a Moving Ball** in video
